### Tutorial on Flexbox Layout
**Demonstration: By creating dice having *one dot* thru *six dots* using a text editor vs-code**
<p>
  In this tutorial, I will teach you how to manipulate the display layout of multiple objects that we have on an HTML page using the Flexbox layout modules. The Flexbox layout, officially called CSS Flexible Box Layout Module, is a new layout in CSS3 made to improve the items align, directions and order in the container even when they are with dynamic or even unknown size. I suggest you to follow all the steps carefully and try to understand each point with patience. If you fail to understand any of the steps, please re-read unless you understand it. Most of the video tutorials I found are not easy to follow because students find it difficult to follow in parallel with the texts. In this tutorial, you can pause and go to any point of the steps that you did not understand.
